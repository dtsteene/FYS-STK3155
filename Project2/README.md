## Abstract
In this project, our focus was centered on classification and regression
problems and how to solve them with neural networks. Specifically, we
have looked at feed forward neural networks and how the optimization
works. The optimization was done through the means of the gradient
descent methods. To further optimize, we have tested different variations
of the gradient descent method, such as momentum, AdaGrad, RMSProp
and ADAM. All methods tested for both stochastic and deterministic
versions. Further, we have applied these methods to a simple univarite
polynomial, Frankeâ€™s function and the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Data.
Testing the regression methods on the univariate polynomial and Franke
function and the classification methods on the Wisconsin Breast Cancer
data set. Across the board, Adam was the top performer
