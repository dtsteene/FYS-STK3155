## Abstract
In this project, we aimed to solve the one-dimensional heat equation using two numerical methods: the Forward Euler method and Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). We sought to draw a comparison between these methods, alongside the analytical solution. Our goal was to evaluate the performance of both PINNs and the Forward Euler method in terms of accuracy, computational speed, and the complexity of implementation. To optimize the PINNs, we experimented with various activation functions and adjusted the number of layers and nodes per layer. Concurrently, for the Forward Euler method, we manipulated different spatial steps to assess its effectiveness. At the end of the project, we observed that while PINNs may not provide a significant advantage for simpler problems, they hold potential to be more effective when dealing with more complex problems.
